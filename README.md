This is my first Git repository as I begin learning version control with Git and GitHub. The purpose of this project is to practice basic Git commands, understand version history, and explore collaboration workflows.

## What I've Learned So Far

- Initializing a Git repository
- Making commits with messages
- Creating and editing a README.md file
- Understanding the staging area and commit history

## Next Steps

- Branching and merging
- Collaborating using GitHub
- Exploring more advanced Git workflows
